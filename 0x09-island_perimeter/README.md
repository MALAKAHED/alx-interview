# Island Perimeter

## Description

This project is about calculating the perimeter of an island represented by a grid. The grid is a list of lists of integers where:
- 0 represents water
- 1 represents land

The grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

## Usage

To use the function, you need to call the `island_perimeter` function with the grid as an argument.
